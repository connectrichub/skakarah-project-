       <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    
       <p class="firstparagraph"> We collect Personal Information from you directly or automatically generated from your use of our Website or services. Even before we have our first direct interaction, we may get Personal Information about you from other sources and third parties.
        
        </p>

        <p>We collect information regarding how you use any of our websites or other digital properties whenever you visit one of them. This includes details about the web pages you visit and the device you are using. Your browser or cookies automatically provide us with this information. We gather this data to enhance your browsing experience and troubleshoot any unforeseen technical issues.
        You might occasionally be invited to complete an online survey or questionnaire when visiting Shakarzahi LLC websites or other digital properties.

        </p>

        <h2>How We Use the Personal Information We Collect</h2>
    <p class="firstparagraph">Shakarzahi LLC exchanges personal information with third parties as necessary for business operations. We only use this approach in the following specific situations:
        Our subsidiaries, related businesses, and other third parties that help us offer you current and prospective future services or for other lawful purposes are given access to your personal information (subject to appropriate confidentiality agreements and our instructions consistent with this privacy notice).<br>
        
        Personal data is given to (a) conform to legal requirements, be in compliance with court orders, legal processes, or enforceable governmental requests; (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including looking into potential violations of such Terms; and (c) identify, contact, prevent, or otherwise deal with fraud, security, or technical issues or (d) if required or permitted by law, defend against impending threats to the safety, property, or rights of Shakarzahi LLC, its clients, or the general public.<br>
        
        In the event of a corporate reorganization, sale of stock or assets, or other change in corporate control involving Shakarzahi LLC or its affiliated companies, we may disclose and transfer personal information to a third party. This includes any transfers made as part of bankruptcy proceedings or insolvency.</p>
    
    <h2>Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>We disclose personal data in the manner listed below:<br>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Service Providers:</span> To make our services available to you, we may disclose Personal Information to third-party vendors, consultants, and other service providers that carry out tasks or provide services on our behalf and by our instructions.</li>
            <li><span>Distributors: </span>To better enable our services, we exchange Personal Information with our distributors;</li>
            <li><span>Business Transaction or Restructuring: </span>If we participate in or are otherwise connected with a corporate business transaction, such as if we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your Personal Information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets; if a third party acquires Shakarzahi LLC or substantially all of its assets, we may disclose your Personal Information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets; or if we restructure our business, we may disclose your Personal Information to the prospective buyer of such business.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>Shakarzahi LLC makes an effort to maintain adequate measures and precautions to ensure against a loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, and destruction of Personal Information in our possession. However, every technique of electronic storage or transmission via the Internet is only partially secure. We, therefore, cannot ensure the absolute security of the Personal Information we collect, even if we make every effort to do so using commercially reasonable means.

We may also employ third-party services to collect this data. The pages you view, the links you click, whether you read emails or click the links inside of them, whether you access the Website from various devices, and other behaviors are all examples of the information we get about how you use our Website. To analyze website traffic and usage trends and learn more about our users' demographics, we may gather analytics data or use third-party analytics tools like Google Analytics.</p>

        <h2>Retention</h2>
        <p>Shakarzahi LLC will only keep your personal information as long as it's required to complete the task(s) for which it was originally gathered, including to meet any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>

        <h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to reveal Personal Information where required by law when doing so is necessary to uphold our legal rights, to comply with a court order or other legal process issued on our Website, or when law enforcement otherwise requests it.</p>
